This repository, msgtool, contains the Java version of MessagingTool. Originally MessagingTool was implemented in Mesa language and run on top of XDE(Xerox Development Environment).
In 1991, I implemented another MessagingTool in C language which could exchange messages with the original Mesa version of MessagingTool.
The C version implemented two protocols: one was based on XNS (Xerox Network Systems) and other was based on tcp/ip-based Sun's RPC.

It was the summer of 1998 when I started to learn Java and implemented another MessagingTool in Java.
Originally, it was implemented with Java 1.02 which didn't support inner class.
